Color Lines game with JavaFX 2.0 client. 
Currently used technologies: Maven, Guice, Guava, TestNG, JavaFX2

There is only very-bad-coded client available now.

There are some issues with buildings now. You should:
*provide mat.dll and javafx-font.dll
*specify javafx.jar in gui-fame/pom.xml

Feel free to contact me with any question.
